# LeetCode Problem 1919: Leetcodify Similar Friends

## Problem Description

In this problem, you're given two tables: **Listens** and **Friendship**. You are tasked to find similar friends based on the following criteria:

1. Users x and y are friends.
2. Users x and y listened to at least three of the same songs on the same day.

You must return all such pairs of friends, ordered by `user1_id < user2_id`.

### Tables:

#### Listens Table:

| user_id | song_id | day        |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 1       | 10      | 2021-03-15 |
| 1       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 1       | 12      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 10      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 12      | 2021-03-15 |
| 3       | 10      | 2021-03-15 |
| 3       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 3       | 12      | 2021-03-15 |
| 4       | 10      | 2021-03-15 |
| 4       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 4       | 13      | 2021-03-15 |
| 5       | 10      | 2021-03-16 |
| 5       | 11      | 2021-03-16 |
| 5       | 12      | 2021-03-16 |

#### Friendship Table:

| user1_id | user2_id |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | 2        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |

### Expected Output:

| user1_id | user2_id |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | 2        |

### Problem Constraints:
- The input contains multiple entries for the same `user_id`, `song_id`, and `day`.
- The result must show pairs of users that listened to at least three songs in common on the same day, and those users should be friends.
- The result should return the pairs in any order but must ensure `user1_id < user2_id`.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Grouping and Counting Similar Songs

This approach involves finding the users who listened to the same songs on the same day, and filtering those who are friends and listened to at least three common songs.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT user1_id, user2_id
FROM (
  SELECT l1.user_id AS user1_id, l2.user_id AS user2_id
  FROM Listens l1 
  JOIN Listens l2 ON l1.user_id < l2.user_id 
                 AND l1.song_id = l2.song_id 
                 AND l1.day = l2.day
  JOIN Friendship f ON l1.user_id = f.user1_id 
                   AND l2.user_id = f.user2_id
  GROUP BY l1.user_id, l2.user_id, l1.day
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) > 2
) s
ORDER BY user1_id, user2_id;
```

#### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Identify pairs of users who listened to the same song on the same day.
- **Step 2:** Filter out pairs who are friends using the Friendship table.
- **Step 3:** Group by user pairs and day to check if they listened to at least three songs together on the same day.
- **Step 4:** We need to use DISTINCT in SELECT clause after the grouping because we might get pairs like (1, 2, 2021-03-15), (1, 2, 2021-03-15) as output and if we use DISTINCT here then nothing happens because they are already unique, thus we need to select the user ids first and then apply DISTINCT to get (1, 2) as unique pair.

## Performance Analysis

### Method 1 (Grouping and Counting Similar Songs):

- **Time complexity:** O(N^2) due to the need to compare each userâ€™s song choices across multiple days.
- **Space complexity:** O(N) for storing the intermediate results.

---

## Conclusion

- **Method 1:** This method works well for problems where checking shared conditions (like songs on the same day) between two users is necessary. However, the quadratic time complexity could become a bottleneck for very large datasets.

### Final Conclusion:
- This approach is efficient and intuitive for this problem but may need optimization for very large datasets.
