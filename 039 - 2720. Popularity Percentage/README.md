# LeetCode Problem 2720: Popularity Percentage

## Problem Description

Given a `Friends` table representing friendship relationships between users on a social media platform, you are to compute the **popularity percentage** of each user. 

Popularity percentage is defined as:
> (Number of unique friends a user has / Total number of unique users on the platform) Ã— 100

The result should display each user along with their popularity percentage, rounded to two decimal places. The output must be sorted by the user ID in ascending order.

### Tables:

#### Friends Table:

| user1 | user2 |
|-------|-------|
| 10    | 11    |
| 11    | 12    |
| 13    | 11    |
| 11    | 14    |
| 11    | 15    |
| 10    | 15    |
| 16    | 10    |
| 17    | 12    |
| 12    | 18    |

### Expected Output:

| user1 | percentage_popularity |
|-------|------------------------|
| 10    | 33.33                  |
| 11    | 55.56                  |
| 12    | 33.33                  |
| 13    | 11.11                  |
| 14    | 11.11                  |
| 15    | 22.22                  |
| 16    | 11.11                  |
| 17    | 11.11                  |
| 18    | 11.11                  |

### Problem Constraints:
- The `Friends` table represents undirected friendships. If user A is friends with B, both A and B are considered friends of each other.
- Users must be counted only once in the total platform user base.
- Output must show all users involved in any friendship either as `user1` or `user2`.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Normalize Friendships and Count Relations

This approach handles the undirected nature of friendships by standardizing entries so that each friendship is counted for both users.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
WITH BDR AS (
    SELECT user1, user2 FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user2, user1 FROM Friends),
    
Users AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user1) AS total FROM BDR)

SELECT user1, ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT total FROM Users) * 100, 2) AS percentage_popularity
FROM BDR
GROUP BY user1
ORDER BY user1;
```

#### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: Use a `UNION` operation to combine both `(user1, user2)` and `(user2, user1)` rows. This ensures every friendship is considered bidirectional.
- **Step 2**: Count the **total unique users** using a CTE.
- **Step 3**: Group by each `user1` to count the number of friends each has.
- **Step 4**: Calculate the popularity percentage using the total unique user count.
- **Step 5**: Round the result to two decimal places for clarity and format.

## Performance Analysis

### Method 1 (Normalize Friendships and Count Relations):

- **Time complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of friendship records. The `UNION`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregation operations all operate in linear time relative to the data.
- **Space complexity**: O(U), where U is the number of unique users, due to storage required for user relationships and intermediate CTEs.

---

## Conclusion

- **Method 1**: Effectively handles the bidirectional nature of friendships and ensures accurate calculation of popularity percentages. The use of CTEs improves readability and maintains logical separation of tasks.

### Final Conclusion:
- This method is efficient and clear, making it a reliable and scalable solution for calculating user popularity metrics on a platform like Meta/Facebook.
